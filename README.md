# Turn Mock-ups Into a Web Page with HTML & CSS

The objective of the project is to create a website using two mockup versions: one for mobile and another for desktop. The website should accurately match the design of both the mobile and desktop mockups. For the tablet version, the design can be adjusted as desired, but the content must be displayed correctly. To ensure responsiveness, efficient breakpoints will be set. Font Awesome icons will be utilized, and the chosen font is 'Railway' from Google Fonts.
